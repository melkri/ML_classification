    "## Steps taken in the project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Grid Search with Cross-Validation: You run the grid_search function, which applies grid search and cross-validation to tune the hyperparameters of your model and select the best ones.\n",
    "2. Bagging: You then use the best hyperparameters to train your final model using a bagging method (like BaggingClassifier or RandomForestClassifier). The hyperparameters you got from the previous step would be used to configure the base estimator of your bagging model.\n",
    "3. Cross-Validation Again: Once you have trained your final model, you can then apply the cross_validation or cross_validation_accuracy function to evaluate the performance of the final model. This step gives you a robust estimate of how well your model is expected to perform on unseen data, as it averages results over several different train/test splits.\n",
    "4. Test Set Evaluation: If you kept aside a separate test set that was not used during any part of the model selection or training process, you could then evaluate the performance of your final model on this test set. This provides a final, unbiased estimate of how well your model is expected to perform on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these steps contributes to building a robust model that generalizes well to new data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Grid search** with cross-validation helps you find the best hyperparameters for your model.\n",
    "* **Bagging** helps reduce the variance of your model, making it more robust to fluctuations in your training data.\n",
    "* **The second round of cross-validation** gives you a robust estimate of how well your final model is likely to perform on new data.\n",
    "* **Evaluation on a separate test** set provides a final check to make sure your model hasn't been overfit to your training or validation data."
